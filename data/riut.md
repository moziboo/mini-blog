### Symbolism & Fate:

- Unlike the other Hallows, the Resurrection Stone does not bring true resurrection—only painful, shadow-like echoes of the dead.
- It represents **temptation and the inability to truly overcome death**, contrasting with Harry’s eventual mastery over death through sacrifice and love.
- J.K. Rowling confirmed in interviews that the stone likely remains lost in the Forbidden Forest, as it was never meant to be used to evade death.
