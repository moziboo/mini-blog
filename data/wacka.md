In _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows_, the **Resurrection Stone** plays a significant role in Harry's journey. Here’s what happens to it:

1. **Harry Inherits the Stone**: The stone is hidden inside **Dumbledore’s Golden Snitch**, which Harry receives in Dumbledore’s will. The Snitch reveals the message _"I open at the close"_, which Harry later understands refers to his impending death.
    
2. **Harry Uses the Stone**: Before facing Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest, Harry opens the Snitch (by pressing it to his lips, accepting his "close" or death). The Stone falls out, and when he turns it in his hand three times, it summons the **shades of his deceased loved ones**—**James Potter, Lily Potter, Sirius Black, and Remus Lupin**—to comfort and guide him as he walks to his supposed death.
    
3. **The Stone is Lost**: After using it, Harry **drops the Resurrection Stone in the forest**, intentionally leaving it behind. He no longer needs it, having accepted death and drawn strength from his loved ones.
